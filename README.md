# React Weather App

This is a simple web app for getting and displaying weather information.

The app uses the open weather map API to get the current weather and a 5-day forecast.
That data is then presented using a webpage built with React.js.

To use it simply type in a city name or geographic coordinates into the input and submit.
The app will then fetch the current weather and a 5-day forecast.
